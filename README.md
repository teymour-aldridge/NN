# NN
A collection of neural networks (all in the form of jupyter notebooks)

# Setup
The easiest way to get setup is to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), which offers a free, cloud-hosted, Jupyter notebook. All notebooks come with a link attached allowing you to run them in Colab. Alternatively, you can download and run them on your PC. 

To run notebooks which utilise external data sources, you will need to modify the data directories specified in the notebooks.
